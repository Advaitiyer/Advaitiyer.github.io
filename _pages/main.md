I am a Data Scientist who mines data and fits it into frameworks that generate business value. Through my academic and professional experience in Data Analytics and Management Consulting, I understand the use-case in short turnaround times, build a data collection methodology, and recommend a predictive/explanatory model with the optimal mixture of bias and variance. Multi-domain cross-functional work has helped me learn how to communicate boring technical insights to management professionals.
