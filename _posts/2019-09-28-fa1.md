Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is built to analyze IBM's 1994-2015 stocks.

**Step 1:** Imported the data into RStudio environment

The data contains:
- Dates (Jan 1994 - Dec 2015)
- IBM's daily return
- Market's daily return
- Daily risk-free rate

**Step 2:** Computed yearly excess returns

```javascript
for (i in 252:lg){
  IBMEXRET_Annualized[i] <- (prod(IBMEXRET[(i-252+1):(i)]/100+1)-1)*100 # Daily excess IBM returns
  marketEXRET_Annualized[i] <- (prod(marketEXRET[(i-252+1):(i)]/100+1)-1)*100 # Daily excess Market Returns
} 
```
Time-series plot of Market's annual excess return:
