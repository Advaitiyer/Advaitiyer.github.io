Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is built to analyze IBM's 1994-2015 stocks.

**Step 1:** Imported the data into RStudio environment

The data contains:
- Dates (Jan 1994 - Dec 2015)
- IBM's daily return
- Market's daily return
- Daily risk-free rate

**Step 2:** Computed yearly excess market and IBM stock returns
```javascript
lg <- length(ibmRET)
IBMEXRET_Annualized <- rep(NA,lg)
marketEXRET_Annualized <- rep(NA,lg)

for (i in 252:lg){
  IBMEXRET_Annualized[i] <- (prod(IBMEXRET[(i-252+1):(i)]/100+1)-1)*100 # Daily excess IBM returns
  marketEXRET_Annualized[i] <- (prod(marketEXRET[(i-252+1):(i)]/100+1)-1)*100 # Daily excess Market Returns
} 
```
Time-series plot of market's annual excess return:

**Step 3:** Found the global maximum

On 3rd September 2010, the market was at the global maximum (75.06%).

**Step 4:** Computed 5-yearly excess market and IBM stock returns
```javascript
IBMEXRET_5Year <- rep(NA,lg)
marketEXRET_5Year <- rep(NA,lg)

for(i in (252*5):lg){
  IBMEXRET_5Year[i] <- (prod(IBMEXRET[(i-252*5+1):(i)]/100+1)^(1/5)-1)*100 # Five-year IBM excess returns
  marketEXRET_5Year[i] <- (prod(marketEXRET[(i-252*5+1):(i)]/100+1)^(1/5)-1)*100 # Five-year Market excess returns
}
```
