Large text file is clustered into 10 different clusters after top 500 words are identified.

**1. Pre-processing**

Cleaned continuous text by splitting it into sentences, removing "\n", and headers.

**2. Top-words**

Built dictionary of words and sorted them in descending order. Identified top 500 words.

**3. Vectorization**

Vectorized the words.

**4. K-Means Clustering**

For k=10, performed k-means using Scikit-learn.
