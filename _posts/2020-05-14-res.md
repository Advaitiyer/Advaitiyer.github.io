**Abstract:** The aim of this study is to propose and implement a dynamic multi-period newsvendor model for a perishable product by incorporating forecasts for profit maximization within optimistic, neutral and pessimistic scenarios learned through partial knowledge of demand. The proposed model is an attempt to simulate the inventory management process under varying levels of risk in order to evaluate risk management strategies.

**Note:** As this is a working paper, the full-length paper is not shared here.

**Results:**

**Profit levels:** Profit forecasts when the manager collects simulates the environment using (1) Monte Carlo, (2) Pessimistic, (3) Optimistic, and (4) Hybrid inventory management policies:

- Poisson distribution of demand:
  * Manager is a far-sighted optimist:

  * Manager is a near-sighted pessimist:

- Weibull distribution of demand:
  * Manager is a far-sighted optimist:

  * Manager is a near-sighted pessimist:

**Conclusion:** The dynamic, manager friendly inventory management system provides the decision maker with flexibility to choose risk levels, and management policy methods (far/near sighted, or optimist/pessimist) than a simple risk-neutral Monte Carlo method. In cases when the demand is unknown, or partially known, well known demand-distribution curves like Poisson or Weibull distribution can be used to approximate them, and train the AI which helps take the best possible approach to manage inventory such that the profit attains highest-possible levels.
