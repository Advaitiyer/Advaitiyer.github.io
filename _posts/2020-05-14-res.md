**Abstract:** The aim of this study is to propose and implement a dynamic multi-period newsvendor model for a perishable product by incorporating forecasts for profit maximization within optimistic, neutral and pessimistic scenarios learned through partial knowledge of demand. The proposed model is an attempt to simulate the inventory management process under varying levels of risk in order to evaluate risk management strategies.

**Forecasts:** The Monte Carlo simulation and the Neural Network under the following settings provides the forecasts as follows:

- Poisson distribution:
  * Farsighted optimist:

  * Nearsighted pessimist:

- Weibull distribution:
  * Farsighted optimist:

  * Nearsighted pessimist:
